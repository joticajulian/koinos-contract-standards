This is a template for new Koinos Contract Standards.

## Long Description

You should elaborate on what problem you're trying to solve here. Tell the world why you believe it makes sense for your idea to be a standard. What are your use cases?

## Specification

Provide a complete technical specification for your smart contract standard that includes the minimum criteria for a token contract to be considered using this standard.

## Optional

You are welcome to include any additional information describing your proposed standard. Some of these could include information about backwards compatibility with previous standards, security considerations, links to reference implementation, and anything else you deem necessary.
